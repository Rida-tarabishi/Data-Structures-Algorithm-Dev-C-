Data Structures Using C (PROG20799)
Assignment #2
In teams of 2-to-3 persons, review, discuss and implement the following problem specification for a chosen
domain. You are required to use the existing code infrastructure produced in class to implement your solution by
adding and extending to the current functionality posted in SLATE\week6 folder. No other outside code is permitted.
Problem Specification: (linked-list implementation)
a) Define an appropriate self-referential structure that contains at least
1 numeric, 1 character and 1 string data type.
b) Manage the selected data using a linked list. A data item should have
a unique alpha-numeric identifier.
c) The use of the atoi()/atof() and gets() functions are strictly not
allowed.
d) Achieve appropriate error checking and robustness by avoiding the use
of the scanf() function. Instead, use fgets(), getchar, and strto()
functions
e) Ensure to consider the user experience and use a looping technique and
a case selection structure to control selection from the following menu:
1) Insert a data item in order
2) Remove a specific data item from the list
3) View a specific data item
4) Print a list of all the data items
5) Exit Application

Marks will be allocated as follows:
1) Insert node into list 10
2) Remove node from list 10
3) View a specific node in the list 5
4) Printing all nodes in the list 5
5) Program Control Flow (menu driven integration) 4
6) User Feedback / User Friendliness 3
7) Unique ID Enforcement 7
8) Input validation & error checking (to achieve, scanf() must not be used) 6
